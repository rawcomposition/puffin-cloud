# PuffinCloud.org

This is a project in the very early stages of development. My primary purpose was to use it to learn React, but I also hope it will be a valuable resource that others can use and contribute images to.
I'll be updating this README with details on how to contribute once I reach a more stable state.

You'll find two main directories:

- api - Strapi installation with GraphQL enabled
- client - React based front-end that consumes the Strapi API
